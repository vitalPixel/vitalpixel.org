				<h2 itemprop="headline">Hi, I'm Pico and I'm a designer.</h2>
				<p>This website (and myself along with it) is being "designed in the open"; you should <a target="_blank" href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/">check out Frank Chimero's project</a> (where I kind of stole the idea from) because it's infinetely more useful than this one.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, you can find me <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com">on twitter</a> and on <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com">on medium</a>, or take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/vitalpixel">my LinkedIn profile</a>. I ocasionally post stuff <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com">on instagram</a> too.</p>

				<h3>Who am I?</h3>
				<p>I like too think that I was born a designer. Professionally, I feel like a product manager that has been wearing multiple product hats for almost 10 years and is currently working as a product owner. I'm constantly looking to improve the way by which content is delivered to humans (especially in digital spaces).</p>
				<p>I love to design (or to designate, or to specify) by writing, having discussions, drawing, taking photos, or making diagrams... I particularly like to do it while traveling and/or listening to music.</p>
				<p>Currently, I'm extremely interested in borders (and crossing them), in politics (or political science) and in complexity theories.</p>

				<h3>What is this?</h3>
				<p>This website is an attempt to force me to do 3 things:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Better organize my thoughts arround issues that are critical to me, by writing more;</li>
						<li>Improve those thoughts by exposing (part of) them to a public audience;</li>
						<li>Keep up to date with modern HTML and CSS (and maybe some very light JavaScript).</li>
					</ol>
				<p>The next post will hopefully explain the project a little further.</p>
