# This is the title of the post
We may or not have an introductory paragraph here.

## This is the heading of first section of the post (the Intro)
The intro is a section like any other, but it might be used for a 'featured' view of the post (like some kind of preview on the homepage).

## This is a heading for a section
This is the body of a section.
I can *bold* or _italisize_ text.

### I can have sub-headings for the section.
I can have bulleted lists:
- To enumerate
- concepts to which order
- is not important.

I can also have numbered lists:
1. To enumerate
2. concepts to which order
3. is important.
