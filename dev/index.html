				<p>This website is being "designed in the open"; you should <a target="_blank" href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/">check out Frank Chimero's project</a> (where I kind of stole the idea from) because it's infinetely more useful than this one.</p>
				<p>You can also find me <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com">on medium</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com">on twitter</a>, or take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/vitalpixel">my LinkedIn profile</a>. I ocasionally post stuff <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com">on instagram</a> too.</p>
			    <p>I like too think that I am a designer that was born wearing a 'product hat'; and I curently work as a product owner. I'm constantly looking to improve the way by which content is delivered to humans (especially on the web)</p>
			    <p>I love to design (or is it to designate? Maybe it's to specify...) by writing, having discussions, drawing, taking photos, making diagrams... I particularly like to do it while traveling and/or listening to music.</p>
			    <p>Currently, I'm extremely interested in borders (and crossing them), in politics (or political science) and in complexity theories.</p>
