            <p>This is meant to be a very simple on-line presence, kind of a mix between the quirky and wonderful personal homepages from the 90s and the low-tech blogs of the early 00s.</p>
            <p>The one goal of this website is to create transparency; to act like a window, or a storefront, that proudly displays whatever organic evolution is happening inside. And hopefully it will drag me – and you – along in that same evolutionary process!</p>

            <h2 itemprop="headline">I'm currently interested in Regeneration</h2>
            <p>I love to design (or to designate, or to specify) all kinds of things by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/VitalPixel">writing and having discussions</a>, drawing or making diagrams, or by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116667869204863084954">traveling</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/vital_pixel/">taking photos</a>... I particularly like to do all of this while <a target="_blank" href="https://music.apple.com/profile/vitalPixel">dancing and listening to music.</a></p>
            <p>Currently, I'm extremely interested in regeneration: earth regeneration, bioregional regeneration, land and soil regeneration, community regeneration, architectural regeneration, individual regeneration...</p>
            <p>I'm particularly interested in how regeneration relates to an urban context. To that extent, my girlfriend and I are currently building our home in my hometown (Porto). We call it <a target="_blank" href="https://shining-seeder-c54.notion.site/A-Bataria-127-b061e73af03b4912b3279276a19cbc3e">"A Bataria 127"</a> and we plan to build it in public as much as possible. For now, it's just a small website (in Portuguese) that we're mainly using to communicate with the architects.</p>
